Privacy Policy

​Last Updated: February 19, 2026

​This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile applications developed by Kreative Solutions ZA (the "Developer"), including but not limited to Tippy Tap Haptics and any future applications published under this developer account.

​1. Information We Collect

​We believe in minimizing data collection to protect user privacy, especially for younger audiences.

​Non-Personal Data: We may collect anonymized data such as device type, OS version, and basic usage statistics to improve app performance and haptic feedback calibration.

​Personal Data: Our apps do not require user accounts, email addresses, or phone numbers. We do not intentionally collect any "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII).

​2. Children’s Privacy

​Our apps, including Tippy Tap Haptics, are designed for all ages, including children.

​We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

​If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately from our servers.

​3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

​We do not sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. We only share data in the following limited circumstances:

​Service Providers: We may use third-party companies (such as Google Firebase for analytics or Unity/AdMob for ads) to facilitate our service. These providers may have access to device identifiers solely to perform tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

​Legal Compliance: We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

​4. Haptics and Device Permissions

​Our apps request permission to use your device's Vibration/Haptics engine to provide tactile feedback during gameplay. This data is processed locally on your device and is never uploaded to our servers.

​5. Security

​We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect any anonymized data collected, though no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
